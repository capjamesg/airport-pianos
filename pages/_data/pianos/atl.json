    "description": "Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has a grand piano where you mention in Terminal E. When I tried to play it on July 22, 2025, it is no longer available for travelers and is roped off since the airport only hires local professional musicians. In addition there is another grand piano located in Terminal A at the top of the escalator in the Piano Bar restaurant. However it is likewise not available to play due to hired local professionals and is off-limits for travelers. ",
